#summary A summary of tested configurations by me or the community

= Introduction =
This page lists all phone/adapters which have been tested with this application.  If you've used a working configuration, please add in the comments.

Unfortunately as you can see the list is short - please help make it longer!

I doubt this widget will work with any releases other than donut (since it uses deprecated API's) however if someone knows differently please let me know!

I would expect it to work with most phones/adapters running the 1.6 (donut) release.

= Tested Configurations =

= My Device Isn't On the List - What do I do? =
Test it with the 1.3 release, available on the Downloads tab OR just download the application from the android market & return it if it does not work.

If it does not work, add an issue on the issues tab, preferably with an adb logcat output using the [http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/adb.html Android Debug Bridge]
