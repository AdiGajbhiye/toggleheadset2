#summary A summary of tested configurations by me or the community

= Introduction =
This page lists all phone/adapters which have been tested with this application.  If you've used a working configuration, please add in the comments.

Unfortunately as you can see the list is short - please help make it longer!

I doubt this widget will work with any releases other than donut (since it uses deprecated API's) however if someone knows differently please let me know!

Test it with the 1.3 release, available on the Downloads tab.  

If it works - upgrade to 1.4 on the market and support this ap!  Also please add your tested configuration to the comments.

If it does not work, add an issue on the issues tab, preferably with an adb logcat output using the [http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/adb.html Android Debug Bridge]
