#summary How to install and use this widget

= Introduction =

This page describes how to install/use this widget.  This widget is meant to specifically address the problems with the 3.5mm audio jack on audio adapters (specifically the HTC 5 in 1 adapter,) the G1 and the donut release.  It hopefully won't be necessary and probably won't work after the next release.


= Installing =
 * Make sure your settings allow install of non-market applications
  * Menu->Settings->Applications->Unknown sources = check.
 * Download the .apk file to your phone and install by selecting the file in a file browser application.
 * Press the "Menu" button
 * Select "Add"
 * Select "Widgets"
 * Select "Toggle Headset 2"
 * Place somewhere on your home screen.

= Using =

 * As long as the service is running (hasn't been stopped due to low resources) the 3.5 mm jack should automatically be selected as output when plugged in on an HTC 3 in 1 adapter.  When you disconnect the htc adapter the audio output should automatically switch back to speakerphone.

 * If you'd like to switch between speaker phone or headset routing manually, click on the widget icon on the home screen.  Audio output should toggle on each click.

 * The icon status should show whether headphone or speaker routing is currently enabled (if you see sound marks on the headphone speakers that means headphone routing is currently on.)
